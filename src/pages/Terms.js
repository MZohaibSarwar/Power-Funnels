            Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services
            that are not owned or controlled by PathSoft.

          <p>
            We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately,

            including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive
            termination shall survive termination, including, without
            limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
            and limitations of liability.

          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
            laws of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of
            law provisions.

          <p>
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of
            these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These
            Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our
            Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might
            have between us regarding the Service.
